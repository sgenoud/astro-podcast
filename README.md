# Astro Starter Kit: Podcasts

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template sgenoud/astro-podcast
```

This is a basic template to create a podcast site. You will need to upload your
mp3 on a CDN (Cloudflare R2 might be a nice fit).

The aim for this is to be easy to hack to make it your own.

You can have a look at the [demo site](https://astro-podcast.netlify.app/)
